- Conditions of satisfaction
- Priorities
- Estimation

## Defining Project Scope and Roadmap

- Release planning
  - Plan for increment by release date
  - Set expectations for each iteration
  1. Project goals
  2. Creating User stories
  3. Prioritize stories
  4. Estimate stor
  5. Grouping stories
  6. Setting a release date
- Iteration planning

  1. Confirm user stories and priorities
  2. Decomposing stories to tasks
  3. Refining estimates
  4. Updating requirements if needed

- **Cone of uncertainty**

  - Less variance in estimates as project progresses

- **Progressive Elaboration**

  - Plan continuously modified, detailed, and improves
  - Changes in priorities and needs
  - Can manage better as projects evolve because

- **Scope**

  - Extent of work that needs to be completed to be considered complete
  - Will change (often grow) during the course of a project
  - Incorporate learning and feedback to create best project

- **Scope Creep**
  - Uncontrolled change. Different than controlled change
  - Introduce change in managed way
  - Agreed to by customers and stakeholders
  - Budget and timeline fixed, but want to add new feature? Eliminate another feature

## Use Cases and Personas

- Common in software and systems engineering
- Sequence of activities / scenarios

  1. Already has an account
  2. Need to create an account

  - Actors: person, organization, or external system

- Personas: Define typical users of systems

  - Concise
  - Visual
  - Name, personality, use, business details, motivation: Helps visualize how users interact with product
  - Implemented to understand what a product needs to do in different scenarios
  - Research, focus groups, talk to potential users, project managers, etc
  - Base them on reality
  - Be specific
  - Goals: Why would they use system,
  - Negative personas: want product to fail
  - Primary and secondary personas

- Help define requirements

## Formatting user stories

- Depict visually

  - Wireframes - page schematics / blueprints
  - Make it easy for UX designer
  - Interact with interface before anything is developed
  - Format for feedback
  - Help customer visualize product early
  - Designer can use as blueprint
  - Developers can use to

- Best Practices:

  - not fancy
  - High level, low fidelity: don't lock into design
  - Get feedback before and during creation
  - Experiment with options
  - Use storyboards to visualize interactions
  - Annotations and notes
  - Explanation: don;t stand on their own

- Start to depict requirements in a visual way
- Simple, feedback, experiment, storyboard, annotate, explain

## Using story maps

- Jeff Patton. Visual way to plan agile projects. Like a roadmap
- Order user activities and tasks
- Sequential
- Focus on user in planning efforts
- Business value focused
- Horizontal axis: high level overview of system (login, enter banking info, view reports)
- First row: Walking skeleton
  - Minimum
- Additional rows - more specific use cases, lower priority the farther down you go
- Easy to visualize iterations: top rows down
- High-level planning and prioritization
- Open approach to supporting goals

  - SPecific cases? Manual work-around? Easiest approach to getting something done.

- Storymaps are a visual planning tool to organize
  - What to build first
  - Support iterative
  - Scope
  - Releases
  - Backlog
  - Open approach

## Agile estimating techniques

- Several techniques depending on goals

### Storypoints

    - Relative estimation
    - Estimate by comparing relative effort of user stories to each other
    - Arbitrary measure (3/medium by one team may be different than same by other team)
    - "size of a story"
        1. Complexity of implementation
        2. Unknowns / risks
        3. Effort to implement
    - Used by scrum teams

### Ideal Days

    - More intuitive
    - Units of time
    - Stories, Backlog, Projects
    - Days for single developer to build, test, and release under ideal conditions (no interruptions and all resources)

### Relative sizing

    - User stories / tasks
    - No absolute value
    - Cheap and fast estimation technique
    - Get implementation experts together and ask relative sizes

### Wideband Delphi

    - 1940s Rand
    - Repeatable
    - Group estimation technique
    1. Schedule est meeting
    2. Describe
    3. Task individual
    4. Reveal
    5. Discuss
    6. Repeat

### Planning Poker

    - Agile teams
    - User story size
    - Build consensus

### Affinity estimation

    - Large number of stories and story points
    - Product owner, dev team, scrum master

## Estimating team velocity

- Actual work (story points) over time
- Sprint (1,2,3,4 weeks)
- Understand capacity of team
- Use current capacity to estimate
  - Expressed as points 20 points per sprint
  - 70 points left - 4 sprints to finish. know time of sprints. Can estimate time
- Average historical velocity data
- Can be hard to determine an initial value
  - Use historical value of team on other projects
    - Must be same team
  - Run an iteration with the team
- Initial velocity often changes over time
- Velocity charts show sum of estimates of work delivered
  - Typically stabilizes over time
  - Provides insight on progress
- Things to consider
  - Continual improvement
  - Causes burnout
  - Increased bugs and issues
  - Changes in team structure will impact velocity
  - Technological complexity can be difficult to predict
  - Miscommunication
  - Changes of customer requirements
  - Tool to help plan projects and release dates
  - But this may change over time
- Useful to plan projects through understanding the capacity of the team
- Don't focus on increasing velocity - just knowing, estimating

## Value-based prioritization

- Expected value a project m

### ROI - Return on Investment

- Value realized vs. value invested in project
- - = profit

### NVP - Net present value

- Capitol budgeting technique

### IRR - Internal Rate of Return

- Interest rate that make NPV zero

### Compliance

- Industry specs, regulations, policies
- Regulatory compliance

### Relative prioritization: user requirements

### Minimum viable product

    - Value based concept
    - What features are sufficient for early adopters

### Customer perspective prioritization

    - Always ensure highest value delivered as early as possible
    - **100 point method**
        - Every customer given 100 points to assign to user stories based on importance
    - **Kano Analysis**
        - Degree of implementation of user stories vs.
        - Degree of customer satisfaction generated by implementation
    - **Multi-voting**
        - Brainstorm list of features and vote on top 1/3 of all ideas
        - Which third of
    - **Carver Technique** evaluates based on. See trends or prioritize
        1. Criticality
        2. Accessibility
        3. Return
        4. Vulnerability
        5. Effect
        6. Recognizability

## Prioritizing User stories with MoSCoW Model

- Prioritize user stories
- Ensure common understanding across team
- Analysts and stakeholder when coming up with user stories and requirements
- Categorize each user story
  - Important
  - Not important
  - Out of scope

1. Must have: minimum usable subset
2. Should have: not critical, but still important
3. Could have : useful, would add value
4. Won't have: explicitly excluded from scope - like to have in the future but definitely wont be in this release

- Process: assign M, S, C, W to each user story
- Look at priorities
  - Difference in opinions on must or should
  - Can use categories for story map
  - M - ranked placed in order in first row for background
  - S goes nest
  - Then C
- Once arranged in storymap, can discuss layers
- Start thinking about user stories based on priorities
- Useful for identifying scope and creating storymap

## Tools for prioritizing requirements

### Kano Model

- Graph-based tool
- Degree of implementation vs. Satisfaction
- Survey end users and customers about implementation or absence of features
- Delighter - unexpected feature user likes
- Satisfier - bring value
- Dissatisfier - basic expectations, users will be upset if they are not there
- Nonessentials: no difference - waste of time and resources
- Focuses on prioritizing things that result in the highest customer satisfaction

### Priority Matrices

- 2 x 2 Urgency (low/high) Importance (Low/High)
- Compare 2 variables
- Urgency

  - Value
  - Cost
  - Risk
  - Releasability

  HI/LU | HI/HU
  LI/LU | LI/HU

## Completing the release plan

- Split and combine stories

  - **INVEST CRITERIA**
    - Independent
    - Negotiable
    - Valuable
    - Estimable
    - Small
    - Testable
  - Some stories are too large or too small

    - Combine smaller stories
      - Developer says longer to estimate than execute story
      - Better prioritization
      - Estimated as a whole vs sum of parts
      - Combine multiple bug reports
    - Split larger stories
      - Based on operations within story
      - Create, Read, Update, Delete
      - Cross-cutting; security, logging, ets
      - Functional vs non-functional (performance, stability, speed)
      - Split based on priority

  - Goal: stories small enough to complete in a few days, not whole sprint

- Assign user stories to iterations - Single, 1-4 week development cycle - Create release plan - Translate user stories into actionable tasks - How to execute - Determine the amount of work the team can complete - List of work for release - User stories to tasks - Can discover new stories tasks - Goal for iteration to maintain focus - theme or goal within iteration - Functionality to develop from release planning stage - Iteration planning takes subset of user stories - Iteration planning meeting - Product owner presents user stories to development team - Requirements - Acceptance criteria - Stories into development tasks - Assign to appropriate members of development team

  **SUMMARY**

- Must split or combine stories to ensure the INVEST criteria
- Assign to iterations at iteration planning meeting
- Dev team gets commitment for assigned tasks for planned iteration

- Create user stories
- Prioritize Stories
- Establish project goals
