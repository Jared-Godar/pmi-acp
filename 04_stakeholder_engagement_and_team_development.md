## Stakeholder Role throughout the APM Model

- Manage relationship between stakeholders and developers
- Phases of APM model
  1. Initiation
  - Product owner establishes project vision
  - Inspire stakeholders and team members
  - Ensure everyone has common understanding of product
  2. Release Planning
  - Plans project work needed to develop product
  - Develops and maintains product backlog
    - Create user stories  
  3. Development
  - Iteration planning - sprints
  - Reevaluate user stories for iteration
  - Product sponsor monitors progress of work
  - Guide and advise as appropriate
  - Product Owner, Domain Expert, Customer Representative - advise design team
  4. Review and Adapt
  - Product team, manager, customers do product demonstrations to examine features
  - Assess performance after each sprint
  - Self organizing and self disciplined, but may need to adapt
  - Status review meetings with executive team, product owner, and project leaders
  5. Closing
  - Retrospectives, post-mortem
  - Lessons learned for future projects
  - Surveys may work instead

- Stakeholders engaged and active in all phases

## Effective Decision-making in Agile Projects

- Agile project - most decisions made as project progresses, not in planning phases
- Requires fast and effective decision
- Overanalyzing or revisiting leads to poor performance

- Focus not on who makes decision, but having the right people involved
- Must have right values and goals
- All team members should agree to employ agile values for goal
- Decision framing
  - Who decision will effect
  - Best group to make that decision
  - Determine if relevant participants take part
  - Opinions have to be heard then discussed
  - Diverse POVs based on experience and background accounted
  - All members must support decision, even if they don't completely agree
  - Consensus, not necessarily unanimous
  - Build trust throughout process
- **Decision Gradient**
  - Users weigh in on visual scale
    - In Favor
    - Ok, but with reservations
    - Mixed feelings
    - Disagree, but will commit
    - Veto
  - Solicit thoughts
  - Reach consensus
  - Traditional method of voting
  - Marked at intervals from left to right
  - Group discussion
    - Why voted the way they did
    - How to resolve issues
