# Agile Principles and Methodologies

- Many ways to manage projects, but they fall into two broad categories:
    1. Defined / Linear 
        - Phases are completed in pre-defined order
    2. Emperical and Iterative Models
        - Use data genereated in previous phases to shape course and outcomes

### Agile is incremental
- For multiple phases of a project:
    - Determine requirements
    - Design
    - Develop
    - Test
    - Deliver

### Agile is iterative
- The checkpoints above are cycled through in multiple iterations:
    - Start with a minimal viable product
    - Test
    - Build more robust features in sucessive rounds

- By being Incremental and iterative:
    - Deliver highes-value items first
    - Identify issues earlier by testing each iteration
    - Get feedback early and often to incorporate into next iteration

## Agile Values and Principles

- Feb 2001 17 independent software practitioners **AGILE MANIFESTO**
    - Driven by features and end product vs. traditional

### Values

1. We value individuals and interactions over proccesses and tools
    - Foster communicationa and collaboration
    - Rethink wasteful processes

2. We value working software over comprehensive documentation

3. We value customer collboration over contract negotiation
    - Can be pain for stakeholders to request change
    - Agile: understood change is going to happen, focus on 
        - Impact for chanve
        - Need for change
        - Value for change

4. We value responding to change over following a plan
    - Dynamically
    - Don't try to define everything up front knowing it will change


### Principles
1. Satisfy the customer
    - Early and continuous delivery of software
2. Welcome change
    - Even late in development
3. Deliver software frequently
    - Couple weeks to months
4. Work together
    - Business and developers
5. Motivate individuals
    - Give environment and support needed and trust to get job done
6. Use face-to-face communication
    - Most effective to and within team
7. Working software = progress
    - Functionalities added
8. Constant pace
    - Sustainable development, no cram sessions
9. Technical excellence
    - Good design
10. Simplicity
    - Art - more features and complexity not always better. 
11. Self-organizing teams
12. Reflection
    - After action reviews at regular intervals and adjust accordingly

## Agile Project Management Model

**Not a  linear progression, cyclical in nature**
1. Envisioning
    - What is the product
    - Value delivered
    - What is the vision

2. Speculating
    - How to implement featiures / functionality 

3. Exploring
    - Iterations of learning
    - Develop code
    - Software
    - Test
    - Feedback

4. Adapting
    - Always optimizing
    - May change priorities
    - May change work methods


5. Closing
    - Wrap one iteration and progress to the next one

## Agile Methodologies

- Many available
- Project type and needs

- Rigid
- Partially
- or Hybrid with another model

**XP: Extreme Programming**
- Software engineering-centric model
- Ongoing rapid delivery of software throug short, one-week iteration

**Lean Principle and Tools**
- Guidelines for streamllining the process
1. Eliminate waste
2. Build qyuality in
3. Create knowldge
4. Defer commitment
5. Deliver fasdt
6. Respect people
7. Optimize the whole

**Kanban**
- Visualize workflow
- Minimize works in progress
- Focus on Workflow
- Continuous improvement

**Crystal Methodologies**
- Family named after colors of crystals by hardness
- As complexity increcreases, so do the number of management steps

**Feature-driven Development**
- Client-centric
- Acchitecture centric
- Pragmatic
- Planned, managed, and tracked at feature level
1. Develop overall model
2. Build a features list
3. Plan by Feature
4. Design by feature
5. Build by feature

**Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**
- Reflects business per
1. Pre-project
2. Project
3. Post-project

**Model Driven Development**
- AMDD: incremental models
- High level model first
1. Assume simplicity
2. Model with a purpose
3. Valuing content above representation
4. Creating quality work
5. Communicating openly
6. Travelling light

**Disciplined Agile Delivery**
- People first
- Learning oriented
- Hybrid model
- Risk value delivery cycle
- Not prescriptive
- Guidelines for strategies and approaches

**Test-driven Development**
1. Add a test
2. Run the test
3. Make a little change
4. Run the test
5. Refactor
Test cases, fixtures, suites

**Behavior-driven development**
- Iterative
- Ubiquitous language between developers and domain experts

## Scrum Framework

- Lightweight framework
- Iterative
    - Sprints: 1-4 weeks; 2 week common
    - Clear goal: set of items to implement in that iteration
    - Goal to have a product increment to inspect at end of each sprint
- Planning between the sprints
- Inspecting and adapting key
1. Sprint planning
    - Deliverables for sprint
    - 
2. Daily Scrum
    - Team  standup 15 min max discuss done, going to do, roadblocks
    1. Completed and why
    2. Plan to do between now and next
    3. Problems team can help with
3. Sprint review
    - Demo product of work to stakeholders
    - Inspect deliverables
    - Adapt if necessary
4. Sprint Retrospective
    - What went well
    - What didnt go well
    - Actions to take to improve

Inspect and adapt throughout process

## Adopting an agile approach

Factors to consider
- Org structure
- Project type
- 
- Team structure

- How does the organization handle change?

**ADAPT**
1. Create awareness
    - Problems, issues, inefficiences
    - How agile can fix
2. Desire
    - From Org or enough people within to make change
3. Ability
    - Support agile approach
4. Promote successes
    - Across the organization
5. Transfer
    - Transition and implement agile methodologies or frameworks

- Moving to agile not easy
- Understand why
- Change doing things
- Governance
- Clear benefits and improvement demonstragted

1. Opportunity
    - Chance to create value
    - Meet a business need
2. Goals
    - Reason why
    - Inspire team
    - SMART
3. Stratrgy
    - Plan to help customer with goals
4. Project Vision

## Creating Vision and Charting a Project

- Direction to steer team 
- Product Vision
    - Compelling statemennt about why
    - Benefit
    - Who building for
    - Why you are uniquiely suited to do it
    - Common understanding of requirements without
    - Interview stakeholders
        - Minimum and max 
        - Risks and benefits
    - How will it add value?
    -
- Project charters
    - Intentions, goals, and outcomes are aligned
    - Vision statement 
        - why of the project. Purpose
    - Objectives / Mission 
        - What
    - Customer
    - Problem 
    - Success criteria
    - Priorities and compromises
    - Risks and mitigation strategies
    - Team roles
        - What is everyone responsible and accountable for
    - One-page document

--- 

## Agile Contracts

- Manage risks and resources
- Traditional
    - Fixed-price: not good for agile, more rigid, bound by limitations not in customers best interest
- Suitable types
    - Service contract: time, cost, materials for roadmap within project
    - Development phase: fixed-price for each iteration
    - Cost-reimbursable / time-and-material: pay as you use
    - Not to exceed with fixed-fee: fixed fee base, not to exceed x% of base
    - Incentive Contract: offers rewards for good performance
        - percentage increase based on time

---

## Agile Documentation

- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Documnetation light - just enough to move forward and make progress
- Simple and visual forms
- Backlog
- Burnup.burndown charts
- Sprint story backlog
- Visual more effective
- Documentation for every process in every project - meny think, but can hinder rather than help
- Manage risk by delivering highest value items first
- Team sharing in collaborative environment
- Thorough details of requirements early are wasteful because they are almost guarenteed to change. 

- Project overview
    - Vision

- Requirements
    - Documented in many forms
    - Product backlog

- Acceptance testing documents
    - Determine if requirements met
    - Work complete and meets expectation

- Support documentation
    - Problem escalation procedures
    - Contacts
    - 

- User documentation
    - Training manuals
    - User manuals
    - Quick reference guide

- Documnents are stil generated, but dont document things you know will change, focus on what matters
